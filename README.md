# CalculiX to Paraview converter (frd to vtk/vtu)

Converts [CalculiX](http://www.dhondt.de/) ASCII .frd-file to view and postprocess analysis results in [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/). Generates von Mises and principal components for stress and strain tensors.

Creates separate file for each output interval - it makes possible to animate time history. 

**Caution!** If you have 300 time steps in the FRD, there will be 300 Paraview files. If you need one file - write output only for one step in your CalculiX model.

**Hint!** If you want/need to only have one file including all of the timesteps, you can easily save everything into one vtkhdf-file in ParaView - either manually in ParaView after loading the .pvd-file or in Python by using ParaView's paraview Package (See section: [Create vtkhdf-file](#create-vtkhdf-file-using-paraviews-simple-module)).

Converter is tested on [CalculiX examples](https://github.com/calculix/examples). Here is how some [test log](https://github.com/calculix/ccx2paraview/blob/master/tests/test.log) looks like.

FRD reader is tested to reduce processing time as much as possible. Now it's quite optimized and fast, but Python itself is slower than C/C++. Here we can do nothing, so, for example, [Calmed converter](https://calculix.discourse.group/t/exporting-mode-shapes/182/7) must be faster - another question is if it's able to read and convert any CalculiX results.

<br/><br/>

# How to use

## Release Version

### Installation

To install and run the latest release (version 3.1.0) of of this converter you'll need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and optionally [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) or [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/): 

    pip install ccx2paraview
    # or, with pipx:
    pipx install ccx2paraview
    # or, within a new conda environment: 
    conda create -n ccx2paraview_rel numpy paraview ccx2paraview

**Hint!** Installing paraview and ccx2paraview from the conda-forge channel can be achieved by adding conda-forge to your channels with:

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict

### Usage 

Having installed ccx2paraview via pip or pipx, you'll need to either cd into the ccx2paraview-directory, or add it to your PATH. Then, run converter with command (both in Linux and in Windows):

    python ccx2paraview.py yourjobname.frd vtk
    python ccx2paraview.py yourjobname.frd vtu

Also you can pass both formats to convert .frd to .vtk and .vtu at once.

Using the conda environment as described above, an additional binary is provided (thanks to conda-forge's package).
Activate the conda-environment first:

    conda activate ccx2paraview_rel

Then, run converter from the python source as described above or use the provided binary:

    ccx2paraview yourjobname.frd vtk
    ccx2paraview yourjobname.frd vtu


### General Remarks

Please, pay attention that .frd-file type should be ASCII, not binary! Use keywords *NODE FILE, *EL FILE and *CONTACT FILE in your INP model to get results in ASCII format.

It is recommended to convert .frd to modern XML .vtu format - it's contents are compressed. If you have more than one time step there will be additional XML file created - [the PVD file](https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Data_formats#PVD_File_Format). Open it in Paraview to read data from all time steps (all VTU files) at once.

Starting from ccx2paraview v3.0.0 legacy .vtk format is also fully supported - previously there were problems with component names.

**Attention!** While developing this converter I'm using latest Python3, latest VTK and latest ParaView. If you have problems with opening conversion results in ParaView - update it.

**Hint!** When using the [conda environment](#installation), a working version of ParaView should be available in the environment already.  

#### Using ccx2paraview in your python code

To use the current release of ccx2paraview in your python code:

```Python
import logging
import ccx2paraview.ccx2paraview

```
conda create -n ccx2paraview_rel numpy paraview ccx2paraview
```


### Paraview **programmable filter**

A snippet for Paraview **programmable filter** to convert 6 components data array to full tensor:

```Python
import numpy as np 
res = np.array([])
pd = inputs[0].PointData['S']
for xx,yy,zz,xy,yz,xz in pd:
    t = np.array([[xx,xy,xz],[xy,yy,yz],[xz,yz,zz]])
    res = np.append(res, t)
tensor = dsa.VTKArray(res)
tensor.shape = (len(pd), 3, 3)
output.PointData.append(tensor, 'S_tensor')
```

A snippet for Paraview **programmable filter** to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors:

```Python
import numpy as np
eigenvalues = np.array([])
eigenvectors = np.array([])
pd = inputs[0].PointData['S']
for xx,yy,zz,xy,yz,xz in pd:
    t = np.array([[xx,xy,xz],[xy,yy,yz],[xz,yz,zz]])
    w, v = np.linalg.eig(t)
    w_ = np.absolute(w).tolist()
    i = w_.index(max(w_))
    eigenvalues = np.append(eigenvalues, w[i]) # max abs eigenvalue
    eigenvectors = np.append(eigenvectors, v[i]) # max principal vector
eigenvectors = dsa.VTKArray(eigenvectors)
eigenvalues = dsa.VTKArray(eigenvalues)
eigenvectors.shape = (len(pd), 3)
eigenvalues.shape = (len(pd), 1)
output.PointData.append(eigenvectors, 'S_max_principal_vectors')
output.PointData.append(eigenvalues, 'S_max_eigenvalues')
```

## Development Version

### Installation from github

To install this converter from github you'll need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and optionally [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/):

    # install vtk first
    pip install vtk
    pip install git+https://github.com/calculix/ccx2paraview.git

    # or, with conda (paraview has vtk, so no need to install it seperately):
    conda create -n ccx2paraview_devel python numpy paraview
    conda activate ccx2paraview_devel
    pip install git+https://github.com/calculix/ccx2paraview.git

**Attention!** Currently, installing vtk via pip seems to break ParaView's pvpython. When using the conda environment, ParaView's included vtk will be used (alongside having a working ParaView in the environment).

### Usage

Run converter with command:

    ccx2paraview yourjobname.frd vtk
    ccx2paraview yourjobname.frd vtu

Also you can pass both formats to convert .frd to .vtk and .vtu at once.

There are also the following aliases for converting files to a fixed format

    ccxToVTK yourjobname.frd
    ccxToVTU yourjobname.frd

#### Using ccx2paraview in your python code

To use the development version of ccx2paraview in your python code:

```Python
import logging
from ccx2paraview.common import Converter
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(levelname)s: %(message)s')
c = Converter(frd_file_name, ['vtu'])
c.run()
```

#### Create vtkhdf-file using ParaView's simple Module

While ccx2paraview cannot convert to vtkhdf directly (yet), you can create such a single file bundling all of the timesteps into one by using ParaView's [simple Module](https://www.paraview.org/paraview-docs/latest/python/paraview.simple.html).
When you are using a [conda environment](#installation) with ParaView, a working version of ParaView's simple Module should be available in the environment.  

```Python
# use ccx2paraview to convert the file '/Users/ccx/ball.frd' 
# into vtu-files ('/Users/ccx/ball.x.vtu') and write a pvd-file
from ccx2paraview.common import Converter
c = Converter('/Users/ccx/ball.frd', ['vtu'])
c.run()

# Convert all vtu-files into one vtkhdf file 
# - the .vtkhdf-extension is mandatory for ParaView to write the correct output
# - The Compression level (0-9) is set to 4 here, making the vtkhdf-file 
#   roughly the same size as the input vtus toghether
from paraview.simple import (SaveData, PVDReader)
pvd_proxy = PVDReader(registrationName='ball', FileName='/Users/ccx/ball.pvd')
SaveData('/Users/ccx/ball.vtkhdf', proxy=pvd_proxy, WriteAllTimeSteps=1, CompressionLevel=4)
```

To install and use ccx2paraview-package: see [above](#installation-from-github).

To test ccx2paraview from local sources after cloning from github, you'll find yaml-files in the ./tests-folder. Using the VSCode extension [Conda Wingman](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DJSaunders1997.conda-wingman) they can easily be built and activated from within VSCode.

The binaries are created automatically when installing with pip from github via the project scripts in [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/calculix/ccx2paraview/blob/master/pyproject.toml): 

    [project.scripts]
    ccx2paraview = "ccx2paraview.cli:main"
    ccxToVTK = "ccx2paraview.cli:ccx_to_vtk"
    ccxToVTU = "ccx2paraview.cli:ccx_to_vtu"

If you have Python version >= 3.8 create binary with [nuitka](https://nuitka.net/):

    pip3 install nuitka
    
    In Windows:
    set CC=C:\\MinGW64\\mingw64\\bin\\gcc.exe
    python3 -m nuitka --follow-imports --python-flags=-m ccx2paraview

    In Linux:
    python3 -m nuitka --follow-imports --python-flags=-m ccx2paraview

If you have Python version < 3.8 create binary with [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/):

    pip3 install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller __init__.py --onefile

Read [how to create packages](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) for [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/):

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade build twine
    python3 -m build
    python3 -m twine upload dist/*

Read about VTK [file formats](https://vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf) and VTK [unstructured grid](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-examples/site/VTKFileFormats/#unstructuredgrid). Remember that FRD file is node based, so element results are also stored at nodes after extrapolation from the integration points.

<br/><br/>

# TODO

Test CALMED binary.

Log memory consumption.

Read binary .frd files: https://github.com/wr1/frd2vtu

Read DAT files: it would be a killer feature if Paraview could visualize results in Gauss points. Use [CCXStressReader](https://github.com/Mote3D/CCXStressReader).

Contribute to meshio. FRD writer. Use meshio XDMF writer: https://github.com/calculix/ccx2paraview/issues/6

Add elementâs material tangent stiffness tensor. Easiest for the paraview user would be to provide it in the (deflected) global cartesian frame. This dataset is useful for checking input data for anisotropic materials, as well as for the stuff with inverse design of fields of this tensor. But itâs a lot more work to produce, especially with nonlinear materials. Itâs almost as useful to see the highest principal value of the stiffness, as a scalar or a vector. (but for the vector you need to do the transformation)
